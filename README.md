# touch-grass

Touch Grass is a Virtical Scrolling Rhythm Game that I have been working on since around the beginning of May 2025 for my college's Game Development unit!

All commits had previously been saved to a private repository that was not kept organised in the slightest (still very new to this), but now after a lot of work on the game, I am in a space where I am proud enough to publish a public repository so people can download builds of the game. Just please don't look at the code, it's an absolute mess :3

All music used in this game is properly credited along with their names in game, and this game is NOT intended for comeertial use. I will not be publishing this game to any indie game sites like itch.io as I do not have the rights to use some of the music in the game. This is simply an assignment for my college and the only available place to download this game is on this repository for testing purposes.

You can download the newest version of Touch Grass here.
